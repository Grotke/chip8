# CHIP-8 Interpreter
This is a CHIP-8 interpreter/emulator in Python. CHIP-8 is a hex-based language, mostly used for games, created in the 70s for the RCA COSMAC VIP computer. As an emulation newbie, CHIP-8 was suggested as a first project before moving onto the NES or Gameboy since it's similar to a system emulator.
